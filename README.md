# Task2
# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Steps Performed:

1. **Generated summary statistics** – mean, median, std, etc.
2. **Plotted histograms and boxplots** for `Age` and `Fare` to visualize distributions and detect outliers.
3. **Created a correlation matrix and pairplot** to observe relationships between features.
4. **Identified key patterns** – such as survival rates by class, gender, and fare.
5. **Drew simple insights** based on visualizations (e.g., 1st class passengers had higher survival rates).

The analysis helps in understanding feature importance and guides further preprocessing or modeling.

## Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
