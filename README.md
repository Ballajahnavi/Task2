# Task2
# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Steps Performed:

1. **Generated summary statistics** â€“ mean, median, std, etc.
2. **Plotted histograms and boxplots** for `Age` and `Fare` to visualize distributions and detect outliers.
3. **Created a correlation matrix and pairplot** to observe relationships between features.

The analysis helps in understanding feature importance and guides further preprocessing or modeling.

## Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
